# Ghormoon's helm repo

## zabbix-helm-chrt

Packaged from https://git.zabbix.com/projects/ZT/repos/kubernetes-helm/browse because they don't package it in a way that would allow to helm pull/install without manually cloning a repo, which breaks my ansible flow.

## openebs-zfs-storageclasses

Minimal chart that deploys storageclasses for openebs zfs-localpv for both containers and zvols.
